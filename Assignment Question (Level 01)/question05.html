    <h2>Hr Tag</h2>

    <p>
        The <u>hr(tag)</u> HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: 
        for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.
    </p>

    <h3>Example:-</h3>
    <p>ยง1: The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>ยง2: The second rule of Fight Club is: Always bring cupcakes.</p>

    <h2>HTML Entities</h2>

    <p>
        Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with entities:

        < (less than) = &lt;
        > (greater than) = &gt;
        HTML Character Entities
        Some characters are reserved in HTML.
        
        If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your HTML text, the browser might mix them with tags.
        
        Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters.
        
        Entity names look like this:

        <br>
    <b>&entity_name;</b> 
    <br>
    <b>Entity numbers look like this:</b>
    <br>
    <b>&#entity_number;</b>
    <br>
    To display a less than sign (<) we must write:
        &lt; or &#60;
    </p>

    <p>
        A commonly used HTML entity is the non-breaking space: &nbsp;

        A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.
        
        Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). 
        This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive.
        
        Examples:
        
        ยง 10
        10 km/h
        10 PM
        Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent browsers from truncating spaces in HTML pages.
        
        If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. To add real spaces to your text, 
        you can use the &nbsp; character entity.
